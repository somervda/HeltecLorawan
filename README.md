# HeltecLorawan
This repository contains a very basic [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/) project for sending Lorawan messages to TTN ([The Things Network](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/)) application.
It has been tested to run on a [Heltec Lora 32 V2](https://heltec.org/project/wifi-lora-32/) development board. And is mostly based on Francois Riotte's 
[TheThingsNetwork_esp32](https://github.com/rgot-org/TheThingsNetwork_esp32) library (Much thanks to Francois, and I recommend going to his repository for any serious follow on work with this library) .
